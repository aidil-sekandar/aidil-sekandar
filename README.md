Greetings! My name is **Aidil Iskandar**, a 17-year-old teenager hailing from the beautiful nation of Malaysia. As a student, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and capabilities. In addition to my academic pursuits, I harbour an ardent passion for programming, which I engage in as a hobby. I am a driven individual, ever-determined to push the boundaries of what is possible and make a substantial impact in the world, and I always seek to evolve and improve, both personally and professionally.
